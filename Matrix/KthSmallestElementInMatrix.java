//Find the kth smallest element in the matrix.--->GFG
/*
 Input:
N = 4
mat[][] =     {{10, 20, 30, 40}
                   {15, 25, 35, 45}
                   {24, 29, 37, 48}
                   {32, 33, 39, 50}}
K = 7
Output: 30
Explanation: 30 is the 7th smallest element.

Expected Time Complexity: O(K*Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
